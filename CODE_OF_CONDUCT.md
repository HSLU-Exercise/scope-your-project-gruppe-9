# 🧭 Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct  
for *scope-your-project-gruppe-9 (HSLU)*

---

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the **scope-your-project-gruppe-9** team pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, inclusive, and healthy learning environment — both on GitHub and during our HSLU teamwork.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others  
* Being respectful of differing opinions and feedback  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
* Taking responsibility and apologizing for mistakes  
* Focusing on what is best for the overall team and learning goals  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery  
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others' private information (e.g., contact data) without permission

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Team leaders (Scrum Master or assigned coordinators) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

They have the right to remove or reject comments, commits, issues, or other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons when appropriate.
